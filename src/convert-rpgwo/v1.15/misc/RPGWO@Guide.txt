RPGWO @ Admin Guide
April 23, 2004

MOST IMPORTANT: YOU represent ME when I am not there. So, represent well.

Intent: To inform on the rules and guidelines that a @ admin on a RPGWO 
 	server should follow.

What: A @ regulates and enforces rules/EULA regarding chat on all levels(global,
	local, mail, post, etc). 

When: Whenever players give you oppurtunities. Mods, @@, and @@@ are too lazy to deal with it, heh
 	And they expect you to deal with it anyways, heh, dang it

How: With the following commands:

	- /a <message>
		- admin chat

	- /warp <xpos>, <ypos>

	- /warpme <player name>
		- should never be used unless a player/tame is blocking
		- whenever a player gets stuck, recommend /suicide
		- meant to deal with bugs not careless players

	- /warpto <player name>

	- /whois <player name>
		- gets logon name and IP of player

	- /ruleadd <rule text>

	- /ruledel <number>

	- /boot <player name>
		- use at will on bad players, outdated though, better to use /ban

	- /imagetype <player name>, <0 - 4>
		- only use on admins, mainly yourself

	- /jail <player name>
		- outdated, better to just /ban

	- /amotd 	
		- admin message of the day

	- /globaldelay <seconds>
		- setting to -1 turns globals off
		- setting to 0 has no delay
		- never set it lower than 60 unless turning it off
		- generally raise the delay if arguments abound or if 
		  the chat is not game related or breaking rules/EULA
		- turns globals off when it is excessive
		- give warning or not, up to you and if you want to be secret

	- /muzzle <name>
		- turns on or off local muzzle on <name>
		- rarely used unless a gross offender or you in right place at
		  right time or another player complains
		- use sparingly

	- /muzzleglobal <name>
		- used the most, you can warn if you want but better to just muzzle
		- note that only you or a @@@ can unmuzzle once a player is muzzled

	- /muzzlepost <name>
		- stops a player from posting

	- /muzzlemail <name>
		- stops a player from mailing

	- /rename <old>, <new>
		- rename if they have an offensive, rude, etc, name
		- if they ask, you are free to charge gold, heh

	- /jailnpc
		- will jail any/all tames you are next to
		- only to be used when tames found in quests, alone or in a city in wrong place

	- /ban <playername>, <days>
		- will ban the player/account for <days> day(s), a -1 is perm ban
		- best to not perm ban, leave that for @@@, a 7 day MAX is good
		- works if they are offline too, I think
		- to be used when the player is very very bad and muzzle did not settle them

	- /macban <playername>, <days>
		- will ban the computer for <days> day(s), a -1 is a perm ban
		- best to not perm ban, leave that for @@@, a 7 day MAX is good
		- works if they are offline too, I think
		- to be used when the player is very very bad and muzzle did not settle them

	- /recentclient
		- displays possible multi-clients
		- the list is formed by logons that have matching computer ID or IP

	- /recentclientremove <name>
		- removes from recent client list and keeps them off it
		- use this after you are satisfied they are not a multi - impossible to tell

Note: Time limits on these commands is up to you and the severity of the "crime". I 
	usually wait a week before I un-muzzle.

Note: If a player, you did a command on, argues with you about it, do not entertain them,
	merely tell them to email mickey@rpgwo.com or the commanding @@@. If they persist
	warn with a banning. Then inform me or the @@@ of the server and we will review
	logs and act accordingly.

Note: Every command you do is logged and we will be able to see exactly what you are doing.
	If you are not sure of an action then contact @@@ ASAP. If we don't respond 
	promptly then use your best judgement. Then we can review the logs and let you
	know what was proper, etc.

Note: Abuse of these commands, like muzzling for no real reason, will not be tolerated
	and will result in immediate permanent banning. I don't want you screwing around
	mis-representing ME. For this reason, see the note above where if you are not
	sure then contact a @@@ before or at least during in order to cover yourself.
	If you are just testing, then that is fine of course, but I just need you to
	respect other players mostly. 

Note: The perk you get is no limit on globals. This of course should not be over used.
	But none the less, use it as often as needed and proper. Warping on your @ player.
	To make an @ admin, just add Admin to your name when creating. Wall walking too
	plus going anyplace. These are NOT to be abused to help your player.

Note: You may be logged in twice on your admin account and your normal player account but
	please do not make a normal player on your admin account. So you would be running 
	2 clients at the same time.
	
Note: If the swearing filter catches something like !@#$ then that is NOT a violation
	of the rules/EULA. Of course if they get around it, LET EM HAVE IT!! I show
	no mercy on those persons.

Note: By the way, make sure you have read and understand the EULA. Even I have to
	read it to remember the rules at times. Any rules you would like added then
	let me or a @@@ know and we can add them if proper.

Note: Rune combos can be globaled, it is part of the game. BUT websites with all of them,
	I do NOT want globaled. That is my only fair restriction.
