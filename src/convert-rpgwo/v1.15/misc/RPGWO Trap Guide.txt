RPGWO Trap Guide

There are many traps both invisible and visible.
This will discuss the invisible ones. The "purple" ones.

There are 2 kinds: quick and normal.
    - quick will reset right away so they can trigger again immediately
      there are only a few quick ones, like Warp and trigger i think
    - normal get triggered then reset back accordingly, you determine
      when it resets in the item process cycles which is 20 seconds per

Normal setup...
    - create the trap(/item or editor) and set it in place
    - set the /itemreset on it (if you fail to set the reset, it will trigger then 
      never re-set and you will have to delete the trap and start over, so it
      would be a one time only trap)
    - use /itemdata to set the values of the trap, for example the damage done
      or the warp destination

Quick setup...
    - create the trap(/item or editor) and set it in place
    - use /itemdata to set the values of the trap, for example the damage done
      or the warp destination


As an admin, when you walk on a trap, it tells you the affect but resets immediately 
as if it were a quick trap.

Each trap uses the /itemdata values differently.

1 - Damage Trap
  - Data1 = damage

2 - Monster Trap
  - Data1 = monsterID    (use /monsterid <name>  to get the ID)
  - data2 = quantity     (8 will surround the player)

3 - Warp Trap   (works same way as warp stones/portals, a portal is just a quick warp trap anyways)
  - Data1 = X
  - Data2 = Y
  - Data3 = Low player level range
  - Data4 = high player level range
  - Data5 = player UUID    (get a player's UUID with /uuid <name>)
  - Data6 = Z

4 - Trigger Trap
  - use /itemtrigger <number>  to set the number
  - note: use /itemtrigger <number> on walls to make them open, only granite, straight walls work with this
  - note: the numbers must match and can have unlimited range
  - note: the walls triggered need /itemreset to make them close
  - note: trigger numbers can be assigned to multiple walls
  - note: trigger numbers are not checked so it is possible to accidentally re-use one

5 - Hero Trap
  - data1 = value

6 - Nova Trap
  - data1 = value

7 - Ice Trap
  - data1 = duration, player cycles, 1 per 4 seconds

8 - Blind Trap
  - data1 = duration, player cycles, 1 per 4 seconds

9 - Heal Trap
  - data1 = value

10 - Revive Trap 
   - data1 = value

11 - Mana trap
   - data1 = value

12 - Item spawn trap  - spawns items around the player like fire
   - data1 = itemid    (use /itemid <name> to get an items id)
   - data2 = quantity

13 - Item transform trap - changes the trap item to new item
   - data1 = itemid
   - note: use /itemreset to make it change back of course

14 - Attune - forces lifestone attunement to the spot
   - no data used

15 - Text Trap  - displays text when you walk on it
   - use /itemtext <message> to set the text
   - note: use to set the mood of an area like... "As you enter the room, you see a glowing warp portal..."
