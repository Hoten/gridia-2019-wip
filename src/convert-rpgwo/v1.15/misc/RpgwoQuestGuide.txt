Example:
    - Marble Quest
        - Talk to Crazy Old Man: He says he lost his Marbles.
        - You explore areas, find marble in the city sewers
        - You return the marbles to the Old Man and he gives a reward.

    - Reuben's Quest
        - You talk to Lisa the beggar: she asks for an apple
        - You get an apple
        - You give apple to Lisa, she gives you a key to catacombs and asks
          for you to look for her dads will
        - You head to catacombs, find ruebens skeleton and kill it, get the
          crypt key, open the crypt, find the will
        - You give will to lisa, she tells you to give to mayor
        - you give will to mayor, mayor gives land deed for lisa
        - you give lisa the deed, lisa gives you V Note

    - Spine Quest (on old Liberty)
        - just a natural cave inhabited by similiar monsters
        - no NPC or story but it does have a history to it
        - A natural cave formed... monsters moved in


Bad Examples:
    - Monster Bash
        - a structure setup with varying monsters with no real theme
          except to get through it and get the prize
        - don't get me wrong, it is fun and challenging but is not
          what we want to do here


How do I make a quest? What steps are involved?
    - No WORK IS TO BE DONE IN WORLD UNLESS APPROVED BY MICKEY
    - Present the basic idea to Mickey or just start designing it
